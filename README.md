## The Business Value

**THE SHORT ANSWER:**

  - Healthy eating - Form healthy habits, not restrictions
  - Grocery shopping - No more planning shopping lists on your own. Tell the app what you want to eat, and the app does the planning

**THE REALLY LONG ANSWER:**

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1) As a transitional app (lets you ease into a diet)**<br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Key value:** Helps you ease into a diet.

> People who go on a diet usually eat what they wish, and switch to a
> diet suddenly. This is a shock to the body and they are more likely to
> experience cravings. Instead, if they use this meal planner for a
> week, they still get to choose what they want to eat. They choose what
> they want to eat and the planner tells them how many  servings to eat.
> They can use this planner to ease into the diet.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2) Healthy eating**<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Key value:** Slim down without starving yourself.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**3) Grocery shopping - Save time. No more planning weekly shopping lists on your own.**

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Example use:**

> Imagine you want to do grocery shopping on a Sunday. You open the app,
> input dates and meals and get meal plans.<br/> You choose whether you
> want to eat cheap (use 'Optimized by Cost') or eat healthy (use
> 'Optimized by Quality').<br/>
> 
> After this, you can either schedule the food to be delivered to you or
> schedule the groceries to be delivered to you and cook or save the
> list on your phone.
